My scene is a fish tank tank, featuring several types of sea creatures and scenery.
I was inspired by the low-poly artstyle of early 3D games, such as quake, but with a more atmospheric approach inspired
by games set underwater such as Abzu. The main character is one of the tang fish, placed near the middle of the scene.
The objects included in the scene are:
